# Project 4 Milestone 2 Grading Rubric

**Milestone 2 is graded out of 20 points and for completion.**

For Milestone 2, you should have developed a design and coding plan for your project based on the information you gathered in Milestone 1. This plan will make it easier for you to implement your project later on.


## Client Feedback & Design Iteration
- [x] Client feedback is documented in `design-journey.md` and does not appear to be fabricated.
- [x] Team used client feedback to iterate design.
- [x] Changes to the design are thoroughly documented.

> Do you have any concerns with the iterated design or client feedback?
Good job taking the client feedback into account! Looks good

## Cognitive Walkthrough
- [x] A list of scenarios/tasks for the cognitive walkthrough is included:
  - Tasks say _what_ the user _wants_ to do, **not** how to do it.
  - For Example: `Share a photograph of a dog and properly label it as such.`
- [x] Team conducted a cognitive walkthrough:
  - Persona choice is rationalized and explained.
  - Walkthrough is conducted for **2** tasks.
  - Cognitive walkthrough was conducted thoroughly and thoughtfully.
  - Evaluation stays true to the persona. No "I" methodology.
  - All questions are carefully answered for all subgoals and actions.
- [x] Cognitive walkthrough exposes design issues.
  - It is very rare to find a "perfect" design.
  - The cognitive walkthrough should have uncovered a handful of issues.
  - Failure to uncover issues, likely means the cognitive walkthrough was not properly conducted.

> What did the team do well? What needs improvement?
Great job with the GenderMag walkthrough! It is very indepth and I'm glad that the team discovered some design issues that can be fixed.

> Are there any issues with the cognitive walkthrough? Should the team redo it?


## Final Design
- [x] Final design is polished and ready for implementation.
- [x] Final sketches take into account information discovered through client feedback and cognitive walkthrough.

> Do the final sketches show a website that has the right level of complexity for this project?
Final sketches look good! Good amount of complexity/interactivity

## Database & Pseudocode Planning
- [x] The schema is organized and sufficient to implement the website.
- [x] The database follows best practices and standard conventions.
- [ ] Pseudocode for **each** page is included.
- [x] Pseudocode is sufficiently detailed so that an outside person can implement the site.

> Do you have any concerns about the team's planning?
The schema should also have comments explaining what each table/field is for, it is a little confusing right now what the user `position_id` is for and how the `positions` table is meant to work. Other than that, schema looks good!

Missing pseudocode for `menu.php`

## Draft Website
- [x] There exists a draft website.
- [ ] Most of the HTML is complete on the draft website.
- [x] Most of the CSS is complete on the draft website.

## Overall

- [x] Milestone is thoroughly and completely done. Team is ready for Milestone 3.
- [x] Is the overall scale and scope of the project of appropriate size. (not too big, not too small)

> Should the team be concerned with the overall progress of the project?
Great job on the overall progress! Design journey is very thorough and thoughtful, it shows a lot of effort was put in. Website is lacking in content right now but I assume when the client gives the team more content it will be easier to fill it up.
