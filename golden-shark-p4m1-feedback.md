# Project 4 Milestone 1 Grading Rubric

Milestone 1 is graded out of 20 points and for completion.


## Team Contract, Client Description & Meeting Notes

- [x] Team contract exists.
- [x] Client selection and description is complete; shows that the group thought about their client choice.
- [x] Client selection is appropriate for the scale and scope of this project. Guidelines are as follows:
  - You can't be your own client.
  - No team member may be a member of the organization for which you are making a website.
  - No team member may have a close personal relationship with the client.
- [x] Meeting notes exist **and do not seem to be fabricated.**

> Do you have any concerns with the selection of the client?
I visited the linked webpage for Plum Tree and the website that came up was a completely different website than the one showcased in the images. This other website has no gallery and does not use a separate website for their menu as noted.
I believe the overall plan for your website seems appropriate for this course. However, implementing the actual order system will require significant security that you may consider not tackling and instead use a previous code base to include.

## Client Requirements & Target Audience Needs

- [x] Is the target audience specific and reasonable for the site?
- [x] The client is NOT the primary target audience. Exceptions must be well justified.
- [ ] Client requirements have been identified and are reasonable given the scope of the project.
- [x] Target audiences needs have been thoughtfully identified.

> Does the planned website seem appropriate for this project?
Yes. Apart from implementing the order system, I believe the rest of your plans seem appropriate for the scope of this class. I particularly think adding a customer reviews section to the website would be really beneficial and shouldn't require too much outside of databases.

## Initial Design & Planning

- [x] The design process is thoroughly documented.
- [x] The initial design and content organization are sufficiently detailed that an outside person can understand the design.
- [x] Does the design appear to meet the client's requirements and the target audiences' needs?

> Do the sketches show an appropriate website for this project?
Yes. Definitely check out other major restaurant websites to get a sense of design for things like the menu. For example, having everything displayed at once like in the sketch may be overwhelming to the user so consider only displaying one category of food at a time based on what's selected.

## Interactivity

- [x] Interactive features appropriately connect with the requirements/needs of the client/target audience.
- [ ] Interactive features are more complex than Project 3.
- [x] Interactive features demonstrate creativity beyond just copying what's has already been done in this class.

> Do you have any concerns about the interactivity?
I'm not entirely sure the interactivity here is more complex than that of previous projects. Consider making it possible for the owners of Plum Tree to upload/remove food items and images to the gallery so that they can keep the website updated in the case of menu changes.

## Distribution of Work

- [x] Short description of work distribution includes assigned duties, work expectations, and expected internal deadlines.
- [x] Distribution of work among team members shares responsibility for all facets of the project; everyone codes AND designs.
- [x] Work distribution seems fair and equitable.


## Overall

- [x] Milestone is thoroughly and completely done. Team is ready for Milestone 2.
- [x] Is the overall scale and scope of the project of appropriate size. (not too big, not too small)

> Should the team be concerned with the overall progress of the project?
No but definitely make sure to check if the included images of the current Plum Tree website matches the website that's currently up.

> Things that the student did well:
Excellent job finding a real-world example of a website that could use an update and planning around the target audience to improve their experience while still maintaining functionality.

> Things that the student could improve upon:
Look into increasing interactivity by allowing Plum Tree owners to modify the website as they please to keep the information up to date with current menus.

## Total

_If submission is obviously incomplete, 0 points. If the submission is mostly complete (> 70%), 20 points._

**Total: ( 20 / 20 points )**
